# FTB Server Installer

Todo: Write a project description

## Usage

This usage guide assumes that the server installed is named `serverinstaller.exe`, the installer downloaded may have a different name such as `ftb-server-windows-amd64.exe` or `serverinstaller_<pack_id>_<version_id>.exe`.

### Windows

You can either double-click on the installer to run it, or you can run it from the command line.

To run from the command line, open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where the installer is located. You can then run the installer with the following command:

```cmd
.\serverinstaller.exe -pack <pack_id> -version <version_id>
```

### MacOS/Linux

Open up a terminal and navigate to the directory where the installer is located. You can then run the installer with the following command:

```cmd
./serverinstaller -pack <pack_id> -version <version_id>
```

## Custom fork behavior

Builds tagged with `BuildFlavor=ngz-custom` skip the official binary self-update
check so an upstream release cannot replace the customized downloader. Sync the
fork with upstream, run the test suite, and publish a new `custom-v*` tag to
produce a fresh Windows x64 release.
